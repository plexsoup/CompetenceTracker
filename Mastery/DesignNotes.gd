"""
Competence Tracker is an app intended to keep track of subject matter mastery.

It serves as a roadmap, to see what milestones we need to hit in order to achieve subject matter mastery.
It also serves as a motivational tool, to encourage users to make those gains.

Inspired by a simple steeplechase type boardgame, with runners jumping over obstacles on their way toward a finish line.

This pedagogy has been widely adopted, including by the Pat and Linda Parelli.
